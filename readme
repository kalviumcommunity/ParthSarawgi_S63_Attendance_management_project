# AttendanceSystem

This project was created as part of my Java learning session.  
The main objective was to **set up a clean Java project structure, verify JDK/Git installation, build a simple "Welcome" application, and push it to GitHub through a Pull Request**.

## 1. Environment Setup

Before writing any code, I ensured my development environment was properly configured.

### JDK Verification
Checked if Java and the Java compiler (javac) are installed:
```bash
java -version
javac -version
