# AttendanceSystem

This project was created as part of my Java learning session.  
The main objective was to **set up a clean Java project structure, verify JDK/Git installation, build a simple "Welcome" application, and push it to GitHub through a Pull Request**.  

---

## 1. Environment Setup

Before writing any code, I ensured my development environment was properly configured.

### JDK Verification
Checked if Java and the Java compiler (javac) are installed:
```bash
java -version
javac -version



## Session 2: Core Domain Modelling
- Defined `Student` class with `studentId`, `name`, `setDetails()`, and `displayDetails()` method.
- Defined `Course` class with `courseId`, `courseName`, `setDetails()`, and `displayDetails()` method.
- Utilized arrays of objects in `Main.java` to manage and display multiple students and courses.
- Introduced basic usage of `this` keyword.

### How to Run
1. Navigate to the project root directory.
2. Compile:
   ```bash
   javac src/com/school/Student.java src/com/school/Course.java src/com/school/Main.java
